## ü§ñ Automated Facebook Poke Back Bot

This Python script automates the process of poking back friends on Facebook. It uses Selenium to interact with the Facebook UI, making it ideal for users who want to maintain their poke streaks without manual effort.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to configure and run the bot:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install selenium
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Download WebDriver

- Download the correct WebDriver for your browser and OS. For example:
  - [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/)
  - [GeckoDriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) (for Firefox)
- Place the WebDriver executable in your system's PATH or in the script directory.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Update Configuration

Modify the script to include your Facebook login credentials and WebDriver path:
```python
EMAIL = "your-email@example.com"
PASSWORD = "your-password"
WEBDRIVER_PATH = "/path/to/your/webdriver"
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Customize Facebook Poke URL

Update the `POKE_URL` in the script with the correct Facebook poke page URL:
```python
POKE_URL = "https://www.facebook.com/pokes"
```

---

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python pokeBack.py
   ```
2. The bot will:
   - Log into your Facebook account.
   - Navigate to the Facebook Poke page.
   - Automatically poke back all pending requests.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizations

- **Run Frequency**  
  You can schedule the bot to run periodically using a task scheduler (e.g., Cron for Linux or Task Scheduler for Windows).
  
- **Browser Options**  
  Modify Selenium WebDriver settings for headless mode:
  ```python
  options.add_argument("--headless")
  ```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

- If login fails, an error will be logged to the console.
- If the poke page URL changes, the script will provide instructions to update it.

---

## üìÇ How It Works

1. **Login Automation**: The bot uses Selenium WebDriver to log into your Facebook account.
2. **Navigate to Poke Page**: It navigates to the Facebook poke page.
3. **Automated Poking**: All pending poke requests are processed in a single run.

---
